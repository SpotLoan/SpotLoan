I am currently in my Third year second semester of Cegep Heritage College Computer Science Program:
I am currently building an IAAA project that will allow other apps to connect to a central communcation system which allows them to identify and authorize users that use their apps.

My goal to reach by the time I graduate:

- Get my resume out there and the fed to land a stable position.
