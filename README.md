I am currently in my Second year second semester of Cegep Heritage College Computer Science Program:
My goal to reach by the end of the semester:
      + Properly learn PHP and C#
      + Eat a little healthier!

My goal to reach by the time I graduate:
      + Land a job in something that I enjoy (at the moment, that is frontend development)
      + Lose 10 pounds and keep it at a consistent weight!
      + Create a project that I am fully proud of that is not apart of an assignment!
